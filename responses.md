## Industry Manipulation

Email, 23rd Jan 2016

> I would like some clarity on a couple of your stated objectives.. One being your goal of giving industry (or experts as you refer to them) free reign to write policy.. Clearly Industry and corporations dictating policy is a major destructive element globally and in our society....   Secondly your statement @the best explained (or sold) policy being implemented over or despite the number of voices.????  Sounds very contradictory to the theme of empowering people..
  Yes we need change desperately , but handing more control to Industry to dictate even more ,  clearly doesn't work for people..
I would love an explanation

We don't want to give anyone free reign over policy, rather we would like specialists and interested parties to have the smallest barrier possible to improving policy.

> Clearly Industry and corporations dictating policy is a major destructive element globally and in our society

Yes, it currently is. However, industry is also one of the largest groups to *gain* from good policy. To pick a non-contentious example: financial businesses have a huge compliance burden in validating every client (Know Your Customer regulations). I'm aware of several efforts from several fronts to solve this problem (knowing your clients aren't terrorists while reducing the cost and liability of holding private data) involving banks to insurance companies and even small forex exchanges. If they could independently come up with better legislation and had the potential to put it forward, that saves the country, and the economy, millions or billions of dollars a year (current compliance costs are in the range of $2 Billion if I'm not mistaken, just in Australia alone). If the industry did put something forward that was good, and we reject it only because it came from industry, then we'd only be shooting ourselves in the foot.

So the question is how then do we encourage that sort of development of policy? In such a way to ensure nobody really has much of a problem with it (which is the case with most legislation, we'll get to the other stuff in a moment). I think the answer is in letting boring (good) policy through. When good policy is suggested it must have a good explanation behind it. When that's the case there will be few parties that strongly disagree, thus in a vote sharing market there will be low demand for the votes, and thus it's very easy to acquire said votes, helping the legislation pass. There is, of course, the rest of parliament to contend with in the early days.

However, if the policy is bad then there will be people out there that don't want it to pass (particularly because it will fail / have bad side effects / etc). In some cases bad legislation would stop here. In other cases it will pass and quickly be noted that it's bad. Flux then focuses on undoing that mistake as quickly as possible; or an improvement. This relates back to the idea that people will argue till the end of days about theoretical matters, but when real progress happens it's hard to ignore. Before rocketry there was a huge debate in the scientific community where one side claimed rockets couldn't possibly work in space. As soon as it happened it ended the debate. Flux hopes to help bring this sort of quality into politics.

> Secondly your statement @the best explained (or sold) policy being implemented over or despite the number of voices? Sounds very contradictory to the theme of empowering people

In some cases it's the only way to empower people. Take a situation with 100 people, 1 or 2 experts, and 98 people who are specialists in other things, but not in this case. Perhaps our experts suggest a policy, and given direct democracy the other 98% might vote no. However, in an ecosystem where those other 98% want to do their own thing more than participating in this one policy, they might swap their votes between issues, and thus our 1 or 2 experts can acquire enough votes to help their legislation pass. If it is bad legislation everyone else will start to take notice, however, if it's good then everyone keeps doing what they're doing and we get better legislation. In order to provide real democratic potential to every person we need to allow them to do things like this, otherwise all the good ideas from our experts get lost, the experts become tired and bitter, and we don't improve as a country.

> Yes we need change desperately , but handing more control to Industry to dictate even more ,  clearly doesn't work for people

Remember that every bit of legislation that comes before Flux / Parliament will have votes distributed to *every* participant. So nobody has anything close to the ability to dictate policy by default (unlike the Westminster system). This means that when something unjust is suggested it is very simple to stop it.

Keep in mind, when thinking about this, that Flux only works as an ecosystem. It doesn't work for one or two issues, it works for hundreds, and we live in a country lucky enough to have hundreds of problems with hundreds and thousands of groups already set up to tackle these issues. Flux is a big step up because it allows us to bridge the real world and Parliament, giving real democratic reach to the people who already care enough to do something about it.

    Hope this helps clarify,
    Cheers,

PS. We're going to release some videos after registration that go into more detail on exactly these sorts of concerns.

## Radicalization

> What happens if everyone decides to vote for a policy that is contrary to some of the higher principles you have. For example everyone registered decides to vote to [insert terrible actions here]?

Flux, like any democratic system, is able to be used for evil as well as good. What we focus on is the ability of Flux to correct mistakes, instead of pushing through the 'right' policy from day one (which we think is part of the problem with canonical democracy). Ultimately we always make room for the possibility that whatever is current policy is wrong, and this means sometimes we might exist in an intermediate place that isn't ideal. To answer your first question: the integrity of Flux is of the utmost importance, so we vote in such a way to maintain that always. Simply: if Flux maintains integrity it is still able to fix mistakes later on, but if we try to vote on personal morals (ignoring the direction of the Flux system) we destroy the integrity of Flux and thus can't use it to fix mistakes later on (or at least the ability is diminished), thus we err on the side of protecting Flux.

The Flux way of dealing with this problem is not to tackle it head on, but rather to incentivise the creation of new options. Some people might call this 'finding a middle ground' but this is misleading because it implies compromise and a mix of two policies. Rather the new options that can solve these sorts of issues are orthogonal to that middle ground. It's difficult to come up with examples because that would solve the problem in and of itself, though I'm sure there are good ideas out there which aren't being considered (and is one of the reasons we're creating Flux).

I want to assure you that if we thought Flux would be to the long term detriment of humanity we wouldn't be pursuing it.

Because of the sharing and swapping marketplace Flux creates (for political power), maintaining long term bad policy is very difficult and expensive[1]. Particularly, in a case where there are two clear sides determined to 'fight it out' each side can continuously introduce amendments and cause the other side to engage (lest legislation passes). [Aside: This is particularly a case where 100% of the parliament used Flux to keep it simpler.] This causes each side to focus their energy *and resources* on two paths: directly defend the status quo (or attempt to alter it, respectively), and submit amendments or new policy strategically. This sort of system produces an equilibrium that is *unstable in the direction of better policy*. This itself is a really fantastic feature, but isn't immediately obvious or easily explained (yet!).

If you don't mind long books: *The Beginning of Infinity* by David Deutsch lays the framework for the explanation. The book is about a way of understanding knowledge and particularly the behaviour of knowledge (which might sound like an odd thing to say, but what I mean is it answers questions like "what do all good explanations have in common" and "what sort of conditions are necessary for progress").

I'm thinking of starting to make some videos where I just answer different questions. The one you've asked is probably the biggest one to answer, and might require an essay in itself.

Unfortunately I'm short on time at the moment, so I will have to leave the explanation somewhat incomplete, though I hope you can see the scaffolding.

Cheers,
Max

Footnotes:

[1] Some definitions:

'bad' policy: formed without an explanation behind it, just an ideological position rather than explanation, arbitrary, etc

'expensive': in the Flux marketplace tokens exist to swap. When attempting to acquire a monopoly position in a vote it becomes asymptotically difficult due to demand and supply.
