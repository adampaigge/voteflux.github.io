                When a Flux candidate is elected they become a gateway for voters to directly
                influence parliament. Unlike other representatives, Flux candidates are not autonomous,
                and their votes in parliament are determined wholly by Flux participants.

                    <p>The first step is distributing votes. Any seats held by Flux are divided among all participants (regular voters and other parties) fairly for each issue. You receive 1 vote for each bill before Parliament.</p>

                    <p>Second, you (and other participants) are free to swap votes with each other, allowing you to accumulate votes for issues <i>you care about</i>. Flux will automate away all the nitty-gritty to make this as simple and seamless as possible. This is where the magic happens.</p>

                    <h3>Why do we need Flux?</h3>

                    <p>Our current system doesn't work well enough; politics gets in the way of policy. Flux is an
                        incremental upgrade to democracy designed to redistribute political power, maximise
                        participation, remove bad policy, and empower voters.</p>

                    <p>The Australian Parliament is based on exclusion and exclusivity and does not equip us with the
                        right tools to solve modern problems to the best of our ability; Flux guarantees the best
                        solutions will never be excluded. In order to solve problems that have never been solved before
                        we need to try things that have never been tried before. Flux embodies this idea, and
                        facilitates it.</p>

                    <p>
                        We believe the best way forward is not to focus on individual solutions but to focus on how we
                        arrive at those solutions, and how we maintain them over time.

                    <h3>What is Flux</h3>

                    <p>Flux, as a party, is a layer for the redistribution of political power. When a Flux candidate is
                        elected they become a gateway for voters to directly influence parliament. Unlike other
                        representatives, Flux candidates are not autonomous, and their votes in parliament are
                        determined wholly by Flux participants.</p>

                    <p>
                        Flux, as a system, is a way to cooperate with fellow voters and distribute power in order to
                        increase the amount of good legislation passed, and make passing bad legislation very expensive
                        and difficult. The focus of Flux is not to be absolutely proportional, or give all voters an
                        equal say on everything. Rather, Flux aims to solve particular problems by enabling those who
                        are particularly well suited to solve that problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flux is designed to produce the best policy above all else.

                <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
                    <h3>How does Flux work?</h3>

                    <p>Flux has many features that are built on fundamentals of economics and philosophy. By providing
                        an open system we encourage the healthy development of policy,
                        the suggestion of new ideas, and a culture of criticism. These are necessary for a healthy
                        democracy.</p>

                    <p>
                        Flux is designed to offer something to everyone. It does this by enabling specialization and so
                        provides a platform for issue based politics, something that is not possible in the generalist
                        Westminster system.
                        Furthermore, it allows projects of any length to be undertaken without being interrupted by the
                        changing political landscape. Long term policy can be worked towards by dedicated individuals
                        even if the time-frame is well beyond a normal 3 year election cycle. Short term innovative policy,
                        or updates to past
                        policy can be made quickly with similar ease, without requiring prior political
                        interest. Provided the policy is of high quality, Flux is designed to make this as simple and
                        painless as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Neutrality and openness to alternate ideas are crucial to Flux operating as a platform that
                        everyone can use. For this reason, Flux has no platform of its own besides parliamentary reform.

                    <p>
                        We are a group of motivated Australians passionate about democracy, technology, solving real
                        problems, and permissionless innovation. (See below for leadership)

                    <p>
                        We do not believe the current system of governance is adequate for today's world, and we are
                        determined to do something about it. We feel disenfranchised and do not identify with major
                        political parties like the ALP, LNP, or Greens. We are particularly dissuaded by the way that
                        every major political party has lost their integrity and become self-serving, instead of
                        representing the interests of society.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We feel that in order to raise living standards, solve global problems, provide employment,
                        lower crime, and solve all other social ills, we must embrace the best solution and best
                        policy, even if we disagree with it. We must have policy backed by the best explanations, not
                        the most voices.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Empower Specialists</h6>
                    Politicians are middle men between specialists and policy, and by cutting them out of the picture we
                    enable specialists to create the best policy they can, unmolested by external political interests.

                    Trading resources is one of the main mechanics behind both the redistribution of wealth and growing
                    prosperity around the globe. Flux introduces this mechanic to the political arena, enabling

                    Flux doesn't have absolute control over the voting system, which is run on a distributed public
                    network and is able to be verified by everyone, everywhere, constantly, and consistently.

                    <h6>Encourages Criticism and Debate</h6>
                    The ecosystem within Flux encourages a culture of criticism around new policy before it's enacted,
                    and demands that policy options can withstand that criticism.

                    Under Flux, lobbyists wouldn't need to convince politicians, they would need to convince the people.
                    In this way special interests become directly accountable to the community they affect, and can't
                    elbow their way through.

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h3>Is membership free?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. Membership is free forever. We don't believe charging a membership fee is necessary, and are working on other
                methods of funding to ensure we can provide open access to democracy to as many people as possible.
            </p>
            <h3>Does Flux have a platform?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes and no. We do have a platform of parliamentary reform, and we deliberately do not have any other platforms.
                We only seek to change the way decisions are made, not to actually make the decisions ourselves.
                The vision of Flux is not to be the source of new policy.
                The vision is to help the best policy be written.

            </p>
            <h3>Are membership details confidential?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. Membership details will be exclusively used for party business, and never sold or willfully disclosed.
                Currently only Nathan and Max have access, though this will expand slightly as Flux proceeds through the registration process.
            </p>

            <h3>Why do I need Flux; I already have a representative?</h3>
            <p>
                While some representatives are good, none are good enough to represent everyone in their electorate.
                Too often people's concerns are ignored because their representative has different views to them.
                Flux believes nobody should be cut off from democracy just because they disagree with their representative.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I still sign up if I'm a member of another political party?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! The AEC is specific in their criterion for registration: "at least 500 members who are on the Commonwealth electoral roll and who are not also relied upon by another party for registration purposes."
            </p>
            <p>
                This means you're able to support Flux as a founding member if you're a member of any other party with a parliamentarian (so Labor, Liberal, Nationals, Greens, etc are all okay). The only time it is an issue is if you are a member of a party who does not have a parliamentarian, and are used by that party to support their registration.
            </p>

            <h3 id="faq-members">How many members are required for registration?</h3>
            <p>
                We can submit anywhere from 500 to 550 members to the AEC for registration.
                However, the counter (currently reading {{flux.members}}) does not reflect how many members have valid details <a href="https://oevf.aec.gov.au/">according to the AEC</a>.
                Often people forget important details like middle names, or suburbs and postcodes on their address.
                This means we actually need more than 550 submissions of interest.
                Please keep telling your friends about Flux even if our membership counter exceeds 550, as every new member increases the chance of successful registration.
            </p>

            <p>Here: <a href="https://voteflux.org/attribution">voteflux.org/attribution</a></p>

            <h3>Is your voting system the same as direct democracy?</h3>
            <p>No. Although there are similarities, they are philosophically very different. The main practical differences are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Swapping votes is allowed</li>
                    <li>Sending votes is allowed</li>
                    <li>Saving 'political capital' over time is allowed</li>
                </ul>
            Some similarities are: conservation of votes and distributing uniformly over the population.

                        planning to use Liquid Democracy as it has a lower utility than a more liquid tokenized form of 'vote'.
                        Particularly, a transferable token allows for a greater degree of reorganization, in addition
                        to allowing voters to 'save' their tokens over time. This is important because it allows
                        a community to focus on big projects and develop a long term, stable, political strategy.
